# Funny-Sentance-Generator
Generates sentences based on a starting input word using Markov Chains trained on Wikipedia pages as Corpora. While , the program does not truly capture the grammatical and logical essence of sentences,it does capture some effects to make meaningful sentences. Few bugs are present, will fix it soon :)
